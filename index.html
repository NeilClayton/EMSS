						<h2>What is self storage space?</h2>
						<p><a href="#">Self storage</a> is essentially a means of hiring a safe, <a href="#">secure room to store goods</a> such as house contents, workshop tools and company documents, or even to use as a small business warehouse. It can only be accessed by the person or persons hiring the room. No-one else has a key and the site is fully alarmed and covered by 24-hour CCTV and a barrier control system for added security.</p>
						<h2>Large or small storage area?</h2>
						<p>There are a variety of room sizes, the smallest being a tiny 6 sq ft, up to 150 sq ft. The height of each room is 9 ft and customers are usually surprised at the volume of goods that can be held in the relatively small space. The self storage area is all ground floor and fully insulated. Disabled facilities are also provided.</p>
						<h2>Industrial Storage including Cars, boats, motorcycles</h2>
						<p>Within our range of<a href="storage.html"> UK storage and industrial space to let</a>, we have a large warehouse which is used for <a href="storage.html">general storage</a>.
